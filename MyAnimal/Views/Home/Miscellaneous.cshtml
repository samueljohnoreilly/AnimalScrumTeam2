<h3>Conservation</h3>
<p>The number of African lions in the wild is declining and they’re now thought to be at risk of extinction. Over the last ten years their numbers have gone down by 30%. The main threat facing African lions in the wild is being killed as part of organised hunts.</p>

<h3>Fun facts about lions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lions are the only cats that live in groups.</li>
    <li>A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how much food and water is available.</li>
    <li>Female lions are the main hunters. While they’re out looking for food, the males guard the pride’s territory and their young.</li>
    <li>A lion’s roar can be heard up to eight kilometres away.</li>
    <li>Lions scent mark their territory, using their wee, to create a border.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where do lions live?</h4>
<p>African lions are mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa. They used to be found all over Africa but now they have mostly disappeared from North Africa and are at risk of extinction in West Africa. Lions live in savannahs and grasslands, where some cover and plenty of water can be found.</p>

<h4>What do lions eat?</h4>
<p>Lions hunt for food every few days. They will feed from their kill and then rest until they hunt again. We follow this pattern in zoos, as our lions have two “starve” days out of seven. They usually kill medium sized mammals, such as zebra, deer and wildebeest. They often eat animals which have been killed by another hunter, such as hyenas. At Folly Farm we feed our lions chunks of meat. We also give them whole dead animals to eat. It’s good for them to eat the whole animal, as the fur, skin and bones give their teeth a good clean. It also helps with ‘enrichment’, which means getting our animals to act as they would in the wild.</p>

<h4>How many types of lion are there?</h4>
<p>The main two types of lion are the African and the Asian but there are thought to be eight in total. Here’s a list:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Barbary lion</li>
    <li>Asiatic lion</li>
    <li>West African lion</li>
    <li>Masai lion</li>
    <li>Congo lion</li>
    <li>Southwest African lion</li>
    <li>Transvaal lion</li>
    <li>Ethiopian lion</li>
</ul>
